##### Mangrove trees occur in a variety of geomorphic and sedimentary settings. Yet, studies investigating their role as habitat providers often focus on the most common biophysical types, such as deltaic, estuarine, open coast or lagoonal mangroves on soft sediments, disregarding less typical environments. Here, we investigated the influence of individual mangrove trees growing on a consolidated backreef system (Laucala Bay, Fiji) on habitat use by reef fishes. Combining field surveys and an experiment, we quantified the extent to which reef mangrove trees serve as habitat for solitary or shoaling reef fishes. Using mangrove tree mimics, we disentangled effects attributable to the physical structure of trees from those related to their bio-chemical properties. We found that fish numbers were 3.7 times higher within close proximity to the mangrove trees than at control sites and correlated significantly with root system perimeter. The roots of larger trees sheltered aggregations of juveniles and adults at incoming and high tides. Mangrove trees and mimics attracted fishes alike. We show that mangrove trees on backreefs provide habitat for shoaling and adult reef fishes in addition to serving as nursery areas, an ecosystem service otherwise lacking on backreef areas with low structural complexity.
